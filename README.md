# Demystifying Poisoning Backdoor Attacks from a Statistical Perspective 

## Introduction

We develop a theoretic understanding of the factors contributing to effective poisoning backdoor attacks. This repo holds our code that conducts both simulated and real-world data experiments to demonstrate the developed theory.

## Files

- `src/experiment.py`: Run the experiments on synthetic two-dimensional Gaussian datasets.
